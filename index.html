<b>Allegra Via</b>   is a physicist and scientific researcher at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Pathology (IBPM) of the National 
Research Council (CNR, Rome, IT). In 2003, she obtained a PhD at the University of Rome "Tor Vergata", where she also 
worked for six years as a postdoc. In 2009 she moved to the "Sapienza University" as researcher, and, since January 2014,
she is the Training Coordinator of ELIXIR Italy. She is involved in the design, organisation and delivery of bioinformatics 
training courses, in Train the Trainer activities where she co-heads the Train-the-Trainer subtask in the EXCELERATE project, 
and collaborates with other ELIXIR nodes on many training-related initiatives. 
She a long track record of academic teaching (Macromolecular Structures, Python programming, Bioinformatics, Biochemistry, Protein 
interactions). My main research interests include protein structural bioinformatics, protein structure and function prediction and 
analysis, and protein interactions. Additionally, she is strongly interested in what researchers have discovered about how people 
learn, how to do the best to best teach them, and how research findings in the science of learning (educational psychology) can be 
translated into common teaching practice. She is a a member of the Global Organisation of Bioinformatics Learning, Education and 
Training (GOBLET) and a Software/Data Carpentry Instructor and Instructor trainer. She collaborates in GTPB since 2010 as a course 
designer and instructor, specifically in the provision of face-to-face courses on Programming in Python.

<b>Pedro Fernandes</b>  graduated in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering at IST (U.T. Lisboa). He worked in Biomedical Engineering, Biophysics and Physiology and changed to Bioinformatics in 1990. He established the first user community in Portugal around the national service provided by the portuguese node of the EMBnet. In 1998 he created the Gulbenkian Training Programme in Bioinformatics, that provided user skills to more than 5000 course attendees throughout its eighteen years of existance. In 2002, in cooperation with Mario Silva from FCUL, he designed a graduate Programme in Bioinformatics. He currently teaches Bioinformatics both in graduate and undergraduate programmes.

					<h2>Course Description</h2>
<b>Python</b> is an object-oriented programming language that is ideal for biological data analysis. The course will start from zero knowledge, and will introduce 
the participants to all the basic concepts of Python such as calculating, organizing data, reading and writing files, program logic and writing larger programs. All 
the examples and practical sessions will focus on solving biological problems.

In particular the sessions will cover:<br>
<ul>
<li>working with DNA and protein sequences</li>
<li>data retrieval from files and their manipulation</li>
<li>running applications, such as BLAST, locally and from a script</li>
<li>finding motifs in sequence</li>
<li>parsing common file formats (Uniprot, GenBank, PDB, BLAST) with Biopython</li>
<!--<li>ways to find and correct program errors</li>  <-->
</ul>
The course will be highly interactive and the students will continuously put theory into practice while learning. By the end of the course, the participants will have
a good understanding of Python basics and will have acquired the skills to manage any type of bioinformatics database record and to run applications from scripts. Basic 
Unix/Linux skills will be provided at the beginning of the course.
<br>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
End-users of bioinformatics databases and tools that aim at developing hands-on capabilities for biological data analysis, ie writing their own or adapting somebody else's 
Python scripts in an autonomous way.<br>
<h2>Course Pre-requisites</h2>
Basic familiarity with bioinformatics data resources such as Uniprot/Swiss-Prot, Blast, ENSEMBL, PDB, etc. The course is directed to biologists with little or no programming 
experience and aims at making them capable to use Python to autonomously manage and analyse biological data.
