and collaborates with other ELIXIR nodes on many training-related initiatives. 
She a long track record of academic teaching (Macromolecular Structures, Python programming, Bioinformatics, Biochemistry, Protein 
interactions). My main research interests include protein structural bioinformatics, protein structure and function prediction and 
analysis, and protein interactions. Additionally, she is strongly interested in what researchers have discovered about how people 
learn, how to do the best to best teach them, and how research findings in the science of learning (educational psychology) can be 
translated into common teaching practice. She is a a member of the Global Organisation of Bioinformatics Learning, Education and
